Azure Policy provides a way of enforcing our auditing your company set of compliancy rules.   It's one of my favourite Azure tools as it enables teams to develop in environments that are 'by design' within a defined and controllable perimeter.

Find more on Azure Policy @https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview 
  
Azure Policy definitions that are currently (as of uploading) not yet integrated natively in Azure will be uploaded here, so stay tuned.
